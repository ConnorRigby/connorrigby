## Automotive Hardware And Software

I do not currently work in the automotive industry professionally, but I do
have quite a bit of experience in this field from other interests. I work on
a handful of projects in this vein. Most of these projects are not currently
or ever going to be completed. I usually only end up implementing enough
to complete whateverer task I have at hand. This means that while the
source code is open and available, I am not actively working on most of these
projects, unless I have a need for it.

### ConeScan

[ConeScan](git@github.com:ConnorRigby/conescan.git) Automotive ECU hacking tool.
Inspired by Forscan, and other various ECU hacking tools such as RomRaider.

### Mazda Rx8 ECU Reverse Engineering Project

[](https://github.com/ConnorRigby/rx8-ecu-dump) Command line J2354 ROM dump
tool and disassembly for the S1 Mazda Rx8. Now embedded in ConeScan.

## Hardware Designs

I mostly work on embedded software, however i also dabble in hardware development.
I'm not super good about keeping these projects updated, as they are usually quite
expensive and time consuming. Below is a short list of what I consider to
be some of better work.

### GD32F405 Development Board

I designed this board to help with the development of [zBLE](https://github.com/connorRigby/zble) a Bluetooth Low Energy library for Zig. It features a GD32F4
microcontrollerr and a handful of wireless modules including Lora and GPS.

### I.MX6 Development Board

Very barebones development board featuring a I.MX6 CPU. I made this to evaluate what
I think is the cheapest platform that can run [Nerves](https://nerves-project.org).
It turned out quite successful, but have backburnered the project for now due to
the global chip shortage.

### Automotive RGB LED controller

I've been working on this one for a long time, it's had many revisions and isn't
complete yet. This is the Original "dream" version. I produced a few of these, but
ultimately decided I wouldn't be able to use a full application processor for it
for my target price. I had a ton of fun designing this, and would love to revisit
this design in the future for another revision. I've written several blog posts about 
the progress of this project [here](https://cone.codes/tags/can-link/)
