# Connor Rigby

Primarily an Elixir developer by trade. I do mostly embedded Linux applications
for fun and profit. Currently working at [KEEP](https://discoverkeep.com) developing a IOT product using
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Nerves](https://www.nerves-project.org/)

Previously worked as a contractor for [BinaryNoggin](https://binarynoggin.com/) and
as the lead embedded developer at [FarmBot](https://farm.bot/)

When not coding for profit, you will likely find me coding for fun. See [Projects](#Unfinished-Projects)
for what that's all about. 

## Open Source

I make as much of my work open source as possible. You will find my most useful contributions
to Nerves and related projects. 

* [Nerves](https://github.com/nerves-project/) - Build embedded Linux Firmware with Elixir 
* [Nerves Hub](https://github.com/nerves-project/) - Remote central firmware update server for Nerves
* [Vintage Net](https://github.com/nerves-networking/) - Linux Networking library for Elixir
* [Blue Heron](https://github.com/blue-heron/) - BLE library for Elixir
* [YourBot](https://github.com/YourBotIs/) - Experimental Discord Bot deployment platform (co developed with [Gulci](https://github.com/Gulci/))
