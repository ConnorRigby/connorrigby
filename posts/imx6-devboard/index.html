An <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/parts/componentSearch?isSearch=true&searchTxt=C1555487">i.MX6 SOC</a>. Most importantly, it can be found in stock! At JLCPCB nonetheless. This prompted me to consider; Could I make a Linux capable device using only components at JLCPCB? Well, spoiler alert - no. But I tried anyway.</p><h2 id=the-major-challenge>The Major Challenge<a href=#the-major-challenge class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>This was a cool discovery - I&rsquo;ve always wanted a low cost platform I can use for small one-off designs. What originally hoped the OSD335xx or OSD32-MP1 platforms could offer me. The global chip shortage really stuffed that one up for me, a hobbiest. What&rsquo;s cool about the i.MX platforms, is they are (mostly) pin compatible. This means I can create a general &ldquo;core&rdquo; module that I can simply plop down on a design and be on my way to prototypes. The only problem - I&rsquo;ve never routed DRAM before. The concept has always terrified me as someone with no propper training in this stuff. I knew the general concepts, some <em>address</em> wires, some <em>data</em> wires, maybe some <em>clocks</em>? Are those differential pairs? What about termination resistors? Something about inductance? Okay so I needed a bit more than a primer. I spent all my free time researching this subject for about 3 days. After reading countless arguments on StackOverflow or watching every KiCAD tutorial on Youtube, I didn&rsquo;t feel that much more confident so I figured it was time to just start failing. Which I did. A lot.</p><p><img src=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/957852929254113300/965619565511974963/unknown.png alt=kicad-pcb-view></p><p>I didn&rsquo;t take many screenshots throughout this process like I normally do, but this about sums the experience up.
Eventually I managed to get the entire circuit routed. NXP has a few app notes and some reference designs that I used as much as I could.</p><p><img src=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/957852929254113300/965655287711297616/unknown.png alt=kicad-3d-view></p><p>During this process, I found a few really useful resources:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/jaydcarlson/mxiot>mxiot</a> - A devboard using this exact SOC. I used this a lot in the beginning for the schematic and general understanding of the platform.</li><li><a href=https://github.com/EnzoRF/nanoberry>nanoberry</a> - More of the above, but developed in KiCAD. I used this <strong>a lot</strong></li></ul><h2 id=the-easy-parts>The Easy parts<a href=#the-easy-parts class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>After getting the high speed DRAM routed, the rest of the process was pretty familiar. I plopped down some connectors I already had laying around in my office for I/O and routed in a WiFi module. This was all that was really needed to test the device out. As I mentioned earlier, the i.MX 6 series are &ldquo;pin compatible&rdquo; with different models. What this means is that although I&rsquo;m currently using the <code>6ULZ</code> version for this now, I could in theory use any of the other devices in this series using the same BGA289 package. So in the name of planning ahead, I added a few more things. Because I eventually want to use this circuit to replace the CM4 in <a href=https://cone.codes/posts/can-link-pt-2/>an another project</a>, I added a CAN transciever and a DB9 connector (which is for better or worse, standard) and of course a buck converter to get 12v down to 5v.</p><p>I also added a couple other things, for no good reason other than because they were in the library and easy to add - a RFM69 SPI radio, and a RP2040.

At the very beginning, I checked their <a href=https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/Capabilities>capabilities</a>
<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/957852929254113300/966840182848495636/unknown.png?width=2160&height=616" alt=caps>
which claim to support 0.2/0.4 vias. What it doesn&rsquo;t say, is that when you actually go to order boards, you have to select a special option that more than doubles the price of the board, and it&rsquo;s still right at the limit of their capabilities. So I ultimately went with PCBWay since I had coupons and the price came out to be cheaper overall with them instead of JLCPCB.</p><p>All said and done, 2 fully populated prototypes cost me $350 shipped to my house. The BOM cost is about $50 per device. I didn&rsquo;t define a firm price that I wanted, but $350 is more than I wanted, but still not <em>that</em> bad. The coolest part about it is that all components were readily available with no signifigant lead time.</p><p>Check back in a month when they arrive and I find out if I can copy/paste out of a reference design well enough to get this device to boot.</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://cone.codes/posts/can-link-pt-4/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
